# AngularJS Playground with ASP.NET MVC and Less

This is a AngularJS playground project that I use to learn and document my findings around AngularJS.

The project could also be used as a starting point to build a web app with these technologies:

* ASP.NET MVC
* dotLess (LessBundle)
* AngularJS 1.7.x
